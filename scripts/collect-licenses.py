"""Collect third-party license information for everything Readymade distributes.

Walks the four places a dependency can enter a build:

  vcpkg     3rdparty/vcpkg/installed/<triplet>/share/<pkg>/copyright
  cmake     <build-tree>/_deps/<name>-src  (CPM + FetchContent, incl. transitive)
  vendored  source copied into 3rdparty/ (crow, yas, mdns, inflect)
  npm       the production closure of each frontend and of the website

and writes two committed artifacts:

  licenses/index.json      the record: every component, and every licence text once,
                           deduplicated by content hash. This is what the licence pages
                           in the website and the apps read, so it is a build input.
  THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md   the same thing for a human, as tables.

--emit-tree additionally writes licenses/<scope>/<component>/ folders of licence files,
laid out by what needs each component rather than by where it came from:

  licenses/service/<serviceId>/   what enabling that one hkp-rt service obliges you to
                                  ship — self-contained, so a component two services
                                  need is written into both folders
  licenses/runtime-core/          the runtime itself: HTTP, serialization, discovery, auth
  licenses/app-shell/             the desktop application around the runtime
  licenses/frontend/              the web app embedded in every app bundle
  licenses/website/               readymadeit.com's bundle, served to browsers only
  licenses/build-only/            runs during the build, never linked into an artifact
  licenses/not-shipped/           present in a dependency store, linked by nothing

That tree is generated on demand and deliberately not committed. It is fully derivable
from index.json, so committing it would store the same bytes a second time with nothing
verifying that the two agree. It is also lossy where the index is not: folders are keyed
by package name, so a package present at two versions keeps only one of its texts.
Emit it for an audit or a release tarball; read the index for anything that must be exact.

The REGISTRY below carries the facts that cannot be read off disk: which build targets
ship a component, how it is linked, what pulled it in, and its scope. Two disagreements
fail the run, so neither a new dependency nor a dependency moving between services can
slip into a release unnoticed:

  * a component found on disk with no REGISTRY entry
  * a curated scope the hkp-rt sources contradict (see SCOPE_MARKERS)

Run with --allow-unknown to generate anyway.

    scripts/collect-licenses.py [--build-dir DIR ...] [--check] [--allow-unknown]

--check regenerates into a temporary directory and diffs against the committed output,
which is what CI should run.
