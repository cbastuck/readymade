# Injector

Injects a configured static value into the pipeline, replacing or providing the current data.

---

## Available in

| Runtime | Service ID |
|---|---|
| Browser | `hookup.to/service/injector` |
| hkp-rt | `injector` |
| hkp-node | `injector` |

---

## What it does

Injector stores a value (set via its UI or configuration) and emits it
on every pipeline trigger instead of the incoming data. If no value has
been configured, it falls back to passing the incoming data through
unchanged.

The most common use is to provide a constant payload — a fixed API
request body, a default configuration object, or a test fixture — that
can be swapped in and out without changing the upstream pipeline.

Injector can also be triggered imperatively: sending
`command.action: "inject"` with a value causes it to fire immediately,
bypassing the normal pipeline flow.

## Configuration

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inject` | `any` | `undefined` | Value to store and emit. Setting this fires an immediate `app.next()` |
| `injectBinary` | `string` | `undefined` | hkp-rt and hkp-node only: base64 payload to store and emit as binary |
| `recentInjection` | `any` | `undefined` | Restore the last injected value on board load (set automatically) |
| `plainText` | `boolean` | `false` | Treat the stored value as a plain string rather than parsed JSON |

### Behaviour

| Condition | Output |
|---|---|
| `recentInjection` is set | Emits `recentInjection` on every trigger |
| `recentInjection` is unset | Passes incoming `params` through unchanged |

Setting `inject` both stores the value as `recentInjection` AND
immediately calls `app.next()` with the value, triggering the downstream
pipeline without waiting for an upstream event.

---

## Input / Output

| | Shape |
|---|---|
| **Input** | Any value (used as fallback when no injection is set) |
| **Output** | The configured `recentInjection` value, or the input if none is set |

## hkp-rt specifics

The hkp-rt service behaves identically, with the differences that come
from living behind a REST API rather than in the same process as the UI:

- A JSON string is injected as `String`, any other JSON value as `JSON`.
- Files are injected as base64 through `injectBinary` and arrive
  downstream as `BinaryData`. Text files still use `inject`.
- The reported state carries `recentInjectionSize` (byte count) instead
  of `recentInjection` after a binary injection, so that large payloads
  are not echoed back to the UI.
- Injections are pushed downstream asynchronously (through the runtime's
  io_context), so `configure` returns before the pipeline has run.

Run the example config:

```bash
./build/hkp-rt/exe/hkp-rt 8887 127.0.0.1 hkp-rt/config/injector-example.json
```

---

## hkp-node specifics

Same behaviour, and the same REST-vs-in-process differences as hkp-rt above:

- `inject` and `injectBinary` push the injected value through the rest of
  the pipeline immediately — the runtime runs the services after Injector
  and reports the result over the runtime's websocket — rather than
  waiting for the next call to reach the service.
- `injectBinary` is decoded from base64 into a `Buffer`. hkp-node's
  pipeline carries binary payloads as `Uint8Array` (the same shape
  `http-server` and `document-extract` use), not as a distinct binary
  type.
- The reported state carries `recentInjectionSize` (byte count) instead
  of `recentInjection` after a binary injection, for the same reason as
  hkp-rt: a large payload is not echoed back to the UI.

See the Node runtime in the demo board below for a working example
(needs hkp-node running locally on port 8080).

## Example: fixed API request body

Store a JSON object that is always sent by the downstream Fetcher:

```json
{
  "recentInjection": { "query": "SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 100", "format": "json" }
}
```

## Example: fire a one-time trigger

Send a specific payload immediately via `configure`:

```json
{
  "inject": { "action": "reset", "timestamp": 0 }
}
```

This stores the value AND fires it immediately through the downstream
pipeline.
