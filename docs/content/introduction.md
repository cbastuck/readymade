# Introduction

This document introduces the core concepts of the hkp platform: boards,
runtimes, services, and the data that flows between them. It ends with a
reference table of every service available across the supported runtimes.

---

## The Board

A **board** is the top-level unit of composition. It is a named
collection of one or more runtimes, each of which contains an ordered
list of services. The board captures a complete, self-contained
description of a data-processing or interactive system.

Boards can be created visually in the browser UI, and the full state of
any board can be exported and restored as a single JSON document. This
document is called a **Board Blueprint**. A Board Blueprint can be
pasted into **Edit Board Source** in the board menu to recreate an
identical setup on any compatible deployment.

A minimal Board Blueprint looks like this:

```json
{
  "boardName": "My Board",
  "runtimes": [
    { "id": "rt-1", "name": "Browser", "type": "browser", "state": {} }
  ],
  "services": {
    "rt-1": [
      {
        "uuid": "svc-1",
        "serviceId": "hookup.to/service/timer",
        "serviceName": "Timer",
        "state": {
          "periodicValue": 1,
          "periodicUnit": "s",
          "periodic": true,
          "running": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See [`docs/llm/circle-text-board.json`](./llm/circle-text-board.json)
for a complete, runnable example.

## Runtimes

A **runtime** is an execution environment that hosts services and
processes data through them. Every runtime on a board runs
independently; runtimes of different types can coexist on the same board
and exchange data via the network services available to them.

Three runtime types are supported:

### Browser Runtime (`type: "browser"`)

Runs entirely inside the browser using JavaScript. No server or
installation is required. All 23 browser services are available
immediately. Ideal for interactive dashboards, rapid prototyping, and
offline-capable applications.

### Remote Runtime (`type: "remote"`)

Connects to an external **hkp-rt** C++ server over GraphQL and
WebSocket. The runtime's processing pipeline runs on the server; the
browser UI shows the controls and receives output via a persistent
WebSocket channel. Remote runtimes unlock the full hkp-rt service set:
audio I/O, FFT, file system access, native WebSocket servers, HTTP
servers, and more.

A remote runtime needs a `url` pointing to a running hkp-rt instance.
Authentication is supported for managed cloud deployments.

### Realtime Runtime (`type: "realtime"`)

An embedded hkp-rt instance hosted directly inside a desktop
application. Used by [**Readymade**](#readymade--local-and-remote-together)
and hkp-saucer. From the board's point of view it behaves like a remote
runtime, but the server runs locally in the same process as the UI —
removing any network overhead and enabling direct audio I/O on the host
machine.

---

## Services

A **service** is a single processing node inside a runtime. Services are
listed in order within a runtime, forming a **pipeline**: the output of
each service becomes the input of the next. A service that returns
`null` stops the pipeline at that point — nothing downstream receives
data from that tick.

Every service has:

- A **`serviceId`** — a URI that uniquely identifies the service type,
  e.g. `hookup.to/service/timer` or `map` (in hkp-rt).
- A **`uuid`** — a per-instance identifier that is stable across saves
  and restores.
- A **`state`** object — the persisted configuration, saved into the
  Board Blueprint and restored on load.
- An optional **bypass** flag that skips the service while keeping it in
  the pipeline.

Services may also expose a **UI component** (in the browser runtime)
that lets the user inspect and modify their configuration in real time.

---

## Data flow

Data enters a pipeline when the runtime is triggered. The trigger can
come from:

- A **Timer** service firing on a schedule.
- A user action (button press, XY pad touch, sequencer step).
- An incoming network message (WebSocket, HTTP POST, SSE stream).
- An explicit `processRuntime` call from another service.

The data object — always a plain JSON-serialisable value — is passed
from service to service. Each service may transform, filter, enrich, or
replace it. The final output of the pipeline can be:

- Rendered visually (Canvas, Monitor, Output).
- Sent over the network (Output, WebSocket Writer, HTTP Client).
- Fed into another runtime on the same board via the Output/Input pair
  or via direct `processRuntime` calls.

### Cross-runtime data exchange

Runtimes on the same board run independently but can exchange data:

```
Browser Runtime                    Remote / Realtime Runtime
─────────────────                  ──────────────────────────
Timer → Map → Output  ──HTTP/WS──► Input → FFT → Monitor
                       ◄──WS─────  (result streams back)
```

The **Output** service sends the current pipeline value to a URL via
HTTP POST or WebSocket. The **Input** service on the receiving runtime
reads from an SSE stream or WebSocket and injects each arriving message
as a new pipeline trigger. This pattern lets browser and server-side
pipelines be composed into a single end-to-end flow described entirely
by a Board Blueprint.

---

## Readymade — local and remote together

**Readymade** is a native desktop application (macOS) that bundles the
hkp-rt C++ runtime alongside the browser-based board UI. When Readymade
starts, it launches an embedded hkp-rt server on a local port and
exposes it to the frontend as a `realtime` runtime.

This means a single board opened in Readymade can simultaneously use:

- **Browser services** — running in the embedded WebView (JS, no install
  needed).
- **Realtime (hkp-rt) services** — running natively in C++ on the local
  machine, with access to audio I/O, the file system, and native
  networking.
- **Remote services** — connecting to additional hkp-rt instances
  running elsewhere on the network or in the cloud.

A Board Blueprint authored in Readymade is portable: the same JSON can be
loaded on a headless server, in a plain browser, or on another Readymade
installation. Services whose runtime type is not available on the target
will simply not restore — the rest of the board remains intact.

```
