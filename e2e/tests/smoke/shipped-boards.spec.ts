/**
 * Every shipped browser-only board loads and instantiates the services it
 * declares.
 *
 * The bug this exists for is drift: a board naming a `serviceId` the registry
 * no longer has. The browser runtime treats that as a `console.error` and
 * returns null, so the service is simply missing — the board still opens,
 * looking fine, minus a piece. Nothing else in the test suite would notice,
 * and neither would anyone opening the board casually.
 *
 * So the assertion is per declared uuid rather than "the page rendered": a
 * frame exists for each service the board asks for. That is narrow on purpose.
 * It does not claim these boards *work* — many want a camera, a key or a
 * network — only that every part they are made of still exists.
