/**
 * An environment check, not a product test: can two browser contexts in one
 * run establish a WebRTC data channel and exchange a message?
 *
 * This is what the peer-chat specs stand on, so it is worth failing here — in
 * twenty lines of plain WebRTC — rather than inside a board. It uses no HKP
 * code and no signalling server: the test process passes the SDP between the
 * two pages, so a failure is about the browser and the machine, not the app.
 *
 * `--disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns` is load-bearing. Chrome
 * replaces host candidates with `.local` mDNS names that two isolated contexts
 * cannot resolve for each other, and without the flag pairing simply never
 * completes — no error, just a channel that stays closed. With it, and with no
 * STUN configured at all, pairing takes well under a second, which is what
 * makes this viable on a CI runner with no outbound UDP.
