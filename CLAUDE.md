# Readymade — Architecture & Philosophy

Readymade is a composable, distributed app framework for building **interactive apps** — things
users open, configure, and use in real time — not automation pipelines. Think what Reaktor is for buolding
synths, but Readymade targets app of any domain, running across runtimes and machines. Services are the building
blocks; boards are the apps you build with them.

---

## Core concepts

### Board

The top-level container. Everything lives on a board. Boards have names and may be associated
with a user account, but this is not required — the playground (readymadeit.com/playground) and
Readymade app (MacOS + iOS + Android + Linux + Windows) run boards locally in the browser with no backend. There is
currently no cloud persistence; boards live in the browser.

### Coordinator

The instance that **owns** a board: it holds the board's engine state — the runtimes, the
services, and the state each of those last reported — and answers anything that needs a view
of the whole board rather than one runtime (resolving a mount, baking references for export).

Coordinating a board and hosting a runtime are **separate roles**, even where one process
plays both:

| Board runs as        | Coordinator | Hosts browser runtimes | Hosts remote runtimes    |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Playground/Readymade | the browser | the browser            | the browser drives them  |
| Cloud board          | hkp-node    | a connected browser    | hkp-node provisions them |

The browser playing both roles is the historical case, not the general one. A runtime host may
pass the coordinator to the services it hosts (`AppInstance.coordinator`), which is how a
service reaches beyond its own runtime; a host that cannot see the board leaves it unset, and
callers treat that as a lookup that has not resolved yet.

A board moves between the two by being **deployed**: built in the playground, where the
browser owns it, then handed to a coordinator that provisions the same runtimes itself and
keeps them running with nobody watching. From then on a browser attaches to it — reads and
configures — and structural changes mean changing the board in the playground and deploying
again. Which side a runtime is cleaned up by is declared when it is created, in the create
payload: `garbageCollected: true` reaps it when its last client disconnects (what a browser
asks for), and saying nothing persists it until an explicit DELETE (what a coordinator gets).

- `hkp-frontend/src/core/coordinator.ts` — the interface and the browser implementation
- `hkp-frontend/src/core/deploy.ts` — handing a board to a coordinator
- `hkp-node/src/coordinator/` — the cloud-board coordinator
- `docs/content/concepts/cloud-boards.md` — the provisioning walkthrough: who owns what, in what order

### Runtime

A board contains one or more runtimes. Runtimes are **chained** — the output of one becomes
the input of the next. Each runtime owns an ordered list of services; that order is the wiring.

| Runtime             | Language   | Communication                       | Use it for                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Browser             | TypeScript | Direct JS call (same process as UI) | UI interaction, fast iteration, most services    |
| Node.js (hkp-node)  | TypeScript | REST                                | Messaging (Telegram, SMTP, IMAP), server I/O     |
| Python (hkp-python) | Python     | REST                                | AI/ML workflows, open-source model inference     |
| C++ (hkp-rt)        | C++        | REST                                | Audio (FFT, WAV, ring buffers), high-performance |
| Go (hkp-go)         | Go         | REST                                | (in development)                                 |
| GraphQL             | —          | GraphQL                             | Legacy; used in one integration                  |

Not all services exist on all runtimes.

### Service

The unit of work. A service sits inside a runtime, accepts data on its input, and produces
data on its output. Services:

- Have a **configure** method called on load and whenever the user changes state or mode
- Have a **process** method called with input data from the previous service, or `undefined`
  if no prior output exists
- Can have multiple **modes** that change how they process data
- Expose an optional **UI panel** (ServiceUI) for interactive configuration; a generic panel
  is shown for services that don't provide one
- Can **emit data autonomously** without receiving input (e.g. Timer)

For browser services, the service and its UI share the same JS process — state sync is a
direct method call. For remote runtimes (Node, Python, C++), the UI communicates via REST;
use **optimistic UI** patterns and sync state through `configure` + `getState`.

### Nesting

Every runtime supports a **SubService** — a service that contains its own ordered pipeline.
This is the primary mechanism for reusable higher-level building blocks.

---

## Data flow model

### Push (normal)

The runtime calls each service in order, passing the output of N as input to N+1. The first
service in the first runtime receives whatever triggered the board (user action, timer tick,
incoming HTTP request, etc.).

### Stopping propagation

Return `null` (or `Null` data type) to signal "nothing to pass on." The runtime stops and
does not call subsequent services or the next runtime.

### Early return (skip)

Return a result early to skip all services that follow in the same runtime. Example: a cache
on a **hit** returns the cached value immediately, bypassing the services that would have
fetched it.

### Inversion of control (pull)

Return `null` to stop the runtime's push, then **asynchronously call the subsequent services
yourself** and act on their results. This shifts the service from passive (reacting to input)
to active (pulling from downstream). Example: a cache on a **miss** lets the downstream
services fetch the value, captures their result, stores it, then emits it to the next runtime.

---

## Data types

Types are shared across runtimes:

| Type                  | Description                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FloatRingBuffer`     | Contiguous float samples with ID + timestamp — the audio type         |
| `JSON`                | Arbitrary structured data (nlohmann::json in C++, plain object in JS) |
| `BinaryData`          | Raw bytes (`std::vector<uint8_t>` / `Uint8Array`)                     |
| `String` / `TextData` | Plain text                                                            |
| `MixedData`           | Binary payload + JSON metadata together                               |
| `Null`                | Signals stop / no output                                              |
| `ControlFlowData`     | Early-return signal, carries result to skip remaining services        |
| `Undefined`           | Uninitialized / not yet set                                           |

**YAS (Yet Another Serialization)** is the binary wire format for non-textual data over REST.
7-byte header (`yas` magic + version/type/endian flags) followed by a type-prefixed payload.

## Board JSON format

```json
{
  "boardName": "string",
  "runtimes": [
    { "id": "ui", "name": "Browser", "type": "browser", "state": { "wrapServices": false } },
    { "id": "node", "name": "Node", "type": "rest", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080", "state": { "wrapServices": false } }
  ],
  "services": {
    "ui":   [ { "uuid": "my-svc", "serviceId": "hookup.to/service/timer", "serviceName": "Timer", "state": {} } ],
    "node": [ { "uuid": "proc-svc", "serviceId": "monitor", "serviceName": "Monitor" } ]
  },
  "facade": { ... }
}
```

Runtime order = chain order. Services within a runtime are ordered top-to-bottom; that order
is their wiring.

A board may also define `blocks` — services (usually sub-services) written once and used by
reference: any pipeline entry `{ "block": "<id>", "params": {…} }` stands for one. Uses are
expanded when the board loads and written back as uses when it saves; while running, a use's
inside is frozen and only its params vary (`docs/content/concepts/blocks.md`). Use `"HKP_RUNTIME_HOST"` as a placeholder in remote URLs when the host
isn't known at design time.

Runtime ids are unique **per user**, not globally — hkp-node namespaces runtimes by the
authenticated `sub`, so the stable ids boards ship (`node`, `chat-node`) don't collide when
two people load the same board against one server.

### Service endpoints (mounts)

A service that must be reachable from outside (`http-server-subservices`, `peer-server`) does
not bind a port. Its runtime assigns it an opaque path on the runtime's own server and
publishes the address in the service's state as `__hkpMount`:

```
http://<host>:<port>/hosted/<mountId>
```

These endpoints are unauthenticated by design — they exist for outside callers holding no
token — so the unguessable id is what gates access. The id is **derived, not drawn**: an
HMAC of the tenant, board, runtime and the mount's name (`mountName`, defaulting to the
service uuid), keyed by a server-held secret (`HKP_MOUNT_SECRET`, else persisted per runtime at
`~/.hkp/<node|python>/mount-secret`). The address therefore survives reloads, restarts and
redeploys — an outside party configured with it by hand keeps working — while staying
uncomputable without the key. Renaming a mount rotates that one address; rotating the
secret rotates all of them. Nothing sensitive enters the board, which says only what the
endpoint is _called_.

Because the address is still assigned at load time rather than written into the board, a
board that needs to point a client at one references the _service_ rather than hard-coding
an address — in whatever field that service already calls its target:

```json
"url": "hkp-mount://<runtimeId>/<serviceUuid>"
```

**One job each.** The reference is what a person writes and what the board keeps;
`__hkpMount` holds the address a mount currently has — published by the owner, written onto
a consumer by the board's coordinator (`coordinator.resolveMount`), never authored. A
consumer prefers `__hkpMount` when it holds an address and falls back to its own field,
where a reference means "not resolved yet" rather than something to dial. Because they are
separate fields, resolution never overwrites what was written, so a saved board keeps its
reference.

References are found by their **scheme**, wherever they appear in service state
(`findMountRefs`) — a `hkp-mount://` value cannot be mistaken for anything else, the same
reason `{{secret.…}}` is resolved wherever it occurs. A bare `<runtimeId>/<serviceUuid>`
would not do: it is indistinguishable from a relative URL, and the hosts these boards run
on resolve those against a base that differs between builds (`hkp://` packaged, `http://`
in dev). Boards that put the reference in `__hkpMount` itself still work.

The vocabulary — field, scheme, parsing, finding — lives in
`hkp-frontend/src/runtime/board/mount.ts`; resolution needs a view of the whole board and
therefore belongs to the coordinator. Exporting a board substitutes the resolved address
into whatever field held the reference, so a receiving service reads it exactly as it
always does. Resolution is lazy, because a board restores all its runtimes concurrently and
the referenced runtime may not have published yet.

The `__hkp` prefix marks a state property whose meaning is defined outside the service
holding it — generic board machinery reads and rewrites it. Reserved: services must not use
such a name for anything else.

---

## Facade layer

A board can define a **facade** — a JSON document that presents a polished, app-like
interface of controls and displays on top of the board. Developers build the internals;
the facade makes the result usable by people who don't know or care about services. Type
definitions live in `hkp-frontend/src/facade/types.ts`.

```json
{
  "layout": "single | columns",
  "panels": [{ "id": "string", "title": "optional", "width": "70%", "layout": { ...LayoutItem } }]
}
```

A **LayoutItem** is either a container (`{ "direction": "row|column", "items": [...] }`)
or a widget leaf with a `"type"` field. Widgets reference services by `serviceUuid`.

| Widget type        | What it does                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `button`           | Sends a configure or `process` action to a service, or a board action      |
| `text-input`       | Text field; `$$input` in the configure payload becomes the typed value     |
| `knob`             | Rotary control; `{{value}}` in configure payload becomes the numeric value |
| `level-meter`      | Vertical bar driven by a service notification                              |
| `canvas`           | Embeds a Canvas service's drawing surface                                  |
| `camera`           | Live camera; the frame it captures goes down the pipeline                   |
| `calendar`         | A day as a calendar: hours down the side, one column per bookable thing     |
| `xy-pad`           | Embeds an XY Pad service                                                   |
| `qr-code`          | Displays a QR code from a service notification                             |
| `message-list`     | Scrolling message thread with optional inline composer                     |
| `status-indicator` | Coloured dot driven by a service notification                              |
| `text`             | Whatever a service is saying, as text — a reason, a summary, a count       |
| `data-table`       | Rows from a service; an array replaces the table, an object appends a row  |
| `file-pick`        | File chooser that sends the file to a service                              |
| `audio-player`     | Plays a service's list of audio files through, one after the next          |

Two things a facade declares beside its panels, both about **what is on screen and when**:

```json
{
  "tabs": [{ "id": "read", "title": "Read", "panels": ["articles"] }],
  "defaultTab": "read",
  "notices": [{ "source": { "serviceUuid": "take-hour", "path": "error" }, "tone": "error" }]
}
```

A panel's `width` is its share of the row it shares with other panels ("70%", or the bare
number) — a starting point the divider between them still overrides, remembered per board.

**Tabs** group the panels into faces, one at a time, because a board's controls rarely all
belong to the same person or the same moment — subscribing to a feed is done once, reading
it every day. A tab is a view over the panels a facade already has: it names panel ids, and
a panel no tab names stays on screen above the bar. `defaultTab` is what everybody gets, so
it names the tab for using the board rather than setting it up.

**Notices** are what a board says without being looked at: a toast raised when a service
reports something, instead of a row kept free for a problem that is usually not there. A
notice reads a service the way a widget's `source` does, fires when that value arrives with
something in it, and never seeds from the state a service was already in.

Use `/new-board` for the full widget schema and board design workflow.

When implementing a service, always produce: service logic, service UI (if interactive),
registry registration, tests, demo board, and docs page. The demo board filename
`<slug>-demo-board.json` is automatically linked from the docs UI.

---

## Design principles

- **Composable first.** Services combine into sub-pipelines, sub-pipelines into boards,
  boards into apps — like crafting. When designing a service, ask: can this be composed with
  others to make something more useful than the sum of its parts?
- **Structured flow over wires.** Explicit wires are like `goto` — they work but make flows
  hard to reason about. Readymade has no wire UI; the ordered service list _is_ the flow. Express
  branching and iteration through control-flow services: a Switch that pattern-matches and
  routes into sub-pipelines, a Filter that stops propagation on a failed predicate, a Looper
  that repeats sub-services until a predicate stops it, an Iterator that runs one pipeline over
  many items, and Tracks that runs many pipelines over one item and reduces their answers.
- **Scoped by concept, not by technique.** A service groups related logic by domain, not by
  implementation. Multiple modes and technologies belong together if they serve the same
  conceptual role (e.g. Input handles event streams and WebSockets — different tech, same
  idea). Complexity lives in composition, not inside individual services.
- **Observable.** Every service has inspectable state and a UI panel. Nothing is a black box.
- **Working and iterable over optimal.** The goal is something you can interact with, adjust,
  and hand to an AI to evolve — not a perfectly architected solution that is hard to change.
- **AI-collaborative.** The decomposed architecture lets AI generate or modify a single
  service without understanding the whole system. Builders stay in control at the concept
  level even without knowing every implementation detail.
